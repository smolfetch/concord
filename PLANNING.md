# Concord Development Plan

## Library Overview

Concord is a C++ library for geodetic coordinate systems, spatial algorithms, and geometric operations targeting GIS, robotics, surveying, and navigation applications.

### Current Status
- Coordinate systems: WGS84, UTM, ENU, ECEF, LTP
- Polygon operations: Ear clipping, triangulation, convex partitioning  
- Spatial indexing: R-Trees, QuadTrees, hash grids
- Geometry types: Points, lines, circles, polygons, bounding volumes
- Modern C++ design: Header-only, exception-safe, template-based

## Critical Fixes Required

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: Zero test coverage - library is untested
- **Fix**: Implement comprehensive test suite
- [X] Create basic test framework setup
- [X] Add unit tests for coordinate transformations
- [X] Add tests for spatial indexing operations
- [X] Add tests for polygon operations
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Set up continuous integration

### 2. Memory Management

- [ ] Profile current performance
- [ ] Implement SIMD batch transformations
- [ ] Benchmark improvements
- **Issue**: Recursive QuadTree traversal
- **Fix**: Iterative stack-based approach
- [ ] Rewrite recursive algorithms
- [ ] Performance test iterative versions
- **Issue**: Frequent small allocations
- **Fix**: Custom memory pools
- [ ] Implement memory pool allocators
